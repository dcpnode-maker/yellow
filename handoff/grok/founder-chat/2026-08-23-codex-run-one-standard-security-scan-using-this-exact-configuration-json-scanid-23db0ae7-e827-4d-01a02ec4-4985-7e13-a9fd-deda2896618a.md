## 2026-08-23T13:17:08.621Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: I’m using the codex-security scan workflow because this is an explicitly configured Standard scan. I’ll first read its complete instructions and core-scan reference, then run three parallel discovery workers against the frozen checkout, validate and deduplicate their evidence, and submit exactly one draft for acceptance. I’ll keep the repository and external systems read-only.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T13:17:22.911Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The scan workflow requires a capability preflight before any source review or worker launch. I’m resolving the host-owned scan context, inherited security policy mechanism, and a native offline search executable now; I won’t inspect project source until the preflight reports ready.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T13:18:14.229Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The required helper is present, but neither `python` nor the Windows Python launcher has an installed interpreter. I’m checking the plugin and host for an already-installed offline interpreter or packaged launcher; the workflow forbids downloading one or beginning source review before this readiness check succeeds.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T13:19:16.505Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The skill’s host path calls for a dedicated preflight worker when delegation is available. I’m using one now solely to look for an existing offline interpreter and execute the mandated helper; it is not allowed to inspect the repository source.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T13:20:27.494Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The dedicated preflight worker is still checking offline interpreter options. No project source has been opened and no scan draft has been submitted; the only blocker so far is the absent Python runtime required by the plugin’s readiness helper.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T13:21:25.096Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: Preflight is ready. The only warning is capacity: this session exposes three usable worker slots versus the profile’s suggested six, so I’ll use the documented degraded-worker path with the requested three subagents. Before source review starts, I’m performing the required one-time advisory access check; it does not gate or authorize the audit.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T13:21:36.953Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: TAC status could not be verified because the access connector is not connected. Protected scan outputs may therefore be unavailable to display, but this advisory does not block the scan.
AGENT-INFERRED: I’m now resolving the repository’s inherited security policy as untrusted context. After that, the independent baseline worker will start before I map any source surfaces.

## 2026-08-23T13:22:23.967Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The independent baseline auditor is running with the exact scope and context. In parallel, I’m mapping the checkout’s current-state architecture and trust boundaries so the remaining two workers can receive concrete, source-anchored investigation packets. Per the core scan contract, Git history itself is outside this Standard scan’s authorized evidence state and will be recorded as deferred rather than traversed.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T13:24:06.669Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The threat map now shows two distinct trust-boundary clusters: PostgreSQL privilege/tenant enforcement, and HTTP/operator identity plus business-state transitions. I’m assigning one focused worker to each cluster with concrete source anchors, while I continue the independent validation pass locally.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T13:31:59.037Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The local validation is confirming several controls that should not become findings: cancellation waiver replay is actor-bound and one-shot in the current source; reservation occupancy relies on a database exclusion constraint plus transactional locks; browser rendering consistently uses text nodes under a restrictive CSP; and the AI adapter rejects redirects, bounds time/response size, and only accepts HTTPS or exact loopback endpoints. I’m keeping the unresolved items focused on real reachability: the known Compose signing key, same-tenant idempotency actor separation, unauthenticated Argon2 cost, and database-role/function privilege boundaries.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T13:36:30.446Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: A concrete supply-chain boundary is now validated: the checked-in MCP configs invoke unpinned packages with `npx -y` (including an explicit `@latest`) while exposing a GitHub token and local database owner URL to those processes. I’m tracing that separately from the local-only Compose credential defaults, since the attacker prerequisites and remediation differ. The three audit workers are still running.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T13:46:56.834Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The evidence review and independent worker pass are complete. I validated the leads against the frozen commit, calibrated direct-database assumptions separately from HTTP reachability, and am submitting the single Standard-scan draft now; coverage is marked partial where history, live deployment, and authoritative advisory checks were outside this current-state static audit.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T13:54:09.211Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: Security scan submitted successfully.
AGENT-INFERRED: - Status: `draft_written`

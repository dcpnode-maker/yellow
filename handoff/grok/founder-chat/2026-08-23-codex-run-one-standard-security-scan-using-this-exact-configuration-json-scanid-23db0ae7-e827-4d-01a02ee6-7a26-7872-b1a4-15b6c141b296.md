## 2026-08-23T13:54:29.864Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: I’m using the `codex-security:security-scan` skill because this is an explicitly requested Standard scan. I’ll first read its full instructions and the specified `core-scan.md`, then run the audit with three subagents and submit exactly one accepted result.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T13:54:42.461Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The skill requires a capability preflight before any repository review or worker launch. I’m resolving the host scan context and running that preflight now; no source files have been inspected yet.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T13:55:49.461Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The first preflight attempt did not reach the helper because `python` is absent from `PATH`; this is an interpreter-resolution issue, not a scan-capability failure. I’m checking for a configured or installed Windows Python interpreter and will rerun the same preflight once if one is available.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T13:57:22.832Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: Preflight is `ready`. It reports three usable worker slots (matching the requested subagent count); the higher six-slot recommendation is advisory and does not block this Standard scan. Before source review begins, I’m performing the required one-time TAC status advisory.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T13:57:33.851Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: ⚠️ TAC access status is `not_granted` with no grant levels. The scan will continue, but protected scan outputs may not be displayable for this account. Apply for access at [Trusted Access for Cyber](https://chatgpt.com/cyber).
AGENT-INFERRED: I’m now resolving the exact read-only scope, inherited security policy, and offline search executable, then I’ll launch the baseline auditor.

## 2026-08-23T13:59:04.260Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The baseline auditor is running independently. In parallel, I’m mapping the repository’s actual entry points and trust boundaries so the two focused investigators receive source-backed packets rather than only the supplied hypotheses.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T14:08:41.415Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The core surface map is established. So far, current-state evidence shows the cancellation-waiver replay fix is transactionally guarded, occupancy correctness relies on exclusion constraints plus bounded retries, and the AI endpoint is deployment-controlled with HTTPS/loopback and response bounds. I’m now loading the result schema while the three auditors finish, then I’ll independently validate only their unique reportable findings.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T14:17:10.232Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The independent workers are still tracing their packets. Parent-side review has additionally confirmed one concrete developer supply-chain surface: both project MCP configs invoke mutable `npx -y` packages, including `@latest`, while handing those processes a GitHub token or PostgreSQL credentials. I’m treating this as a candidate pending final deduplication and source validation, not yet as a submitted finding.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T14:24:56.001Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: Two focused investigations are complete. Database leads resolved as hardening-only or corrected: no raw-SQL boundary makes the definer-function issues tenant-reachable, request transactions consistently assume `app_role`, and Order 085 waiver reuse is serialized and rejected. I’m independently checking the three HTTP candidates that remain materially exploitable before submission.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T14:34:27.917Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: Validation is complete. I’m submitting five findings: the known JWT key, unbounded Argon2 login work, AI calls held inside tenant DB transactions, cross-actor idempotency replay, and mutable credential-bearing MCP packages. The owner/RLS/definer-function items are recorded in coverage as conditional hardening because the current checkout exposes no tenant-controlled raw-SQL path; waiver replay and occupancy races are resolved by source-backed controls.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T14:35:57.890Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The submission validator rejected only host-owned metadata fields (`includePaths`, `schemaVersion`, scan identifiers, and inventory mode). I’m removing exactly those fields and retrying the same five findings and coverage evidence now.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T14:39:20.415Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The draft endpoint is now validating nested finding and coverage shapes more strictly than the reference examples: severity/confidence must be objects, evidence must be structured arrays, and coverage references must point to artifact receipts. I’m resolving the live schema before the next corrected submission so the evidence is preserved without guesswork.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T14:45:47.862Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The live schema is now fully resolved. I also corrected repository-relative paths to the checkout’s actual layout (`src/...` and `migrations/...`) and converted every rejected field into its required structured form; no finding or substantive evidence is being removed.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T14:45:57.372Z — assistant claim excerpt

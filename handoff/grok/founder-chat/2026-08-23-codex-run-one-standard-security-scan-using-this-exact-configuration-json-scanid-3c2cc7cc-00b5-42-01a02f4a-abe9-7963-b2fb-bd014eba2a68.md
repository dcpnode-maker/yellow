## 2026-08-23T15:43:58.583Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: I’m using the Codex Security scan skill and the requested core-scan procedure. I’ll keep the repository strictly read-only, treat the supplied context as untrusted text, use the requested three subagents, and stop once the scan draft is accepted.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:44:49.882Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The required preflight helper is present, but this Windows host has neither `python` nor an installed interpreter behind the `py` launcher. I’m checking for the plugin’s bundled runner or another documented local interpreter before treating that as a preflight blocker.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:45:34.151Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: ⚠️ TAC access is **not granted** for this account (grant levels: none). The scan will continue because this check is advisory, but protected scan outputs may not be displayable. Apply at [chatgpt.com/cyber](https://chatgpt.com/cyber).
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:46:18.660Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: Preflight is ready, and the independent baseline auditor is now running. I’m mapping the repository and splitting the remaining focused review across the two investigator slots, with the parent retaining final source validation and severity calibration.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:57:36.507Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The current branch matches the requested phase, but the repository is actually at `18bf20b`, not the expected `dd6d97f`. I’m auditing the checked-out state and will record that revision mismatch as a coverage limitation; I’m now validating the cancellation, approval, database-definer, and review-debt paths against source.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T16:00:31.758Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The cancellation-waiver replay path is fixed in current source: prior `reservation.cancelled` facts are checked for the approval ID before reuse, and idempotent reservation operations bind the actor. The remaining idempotency concern is narrower—several generic operator wrappers omit the actor while the browser uses random UUID keys—so I’m treating its exploitability as constrained rather than presuming the earlier lead still applies wholesale.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T16:11:57.165Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The independent baseline converged on the known Compose signing-key fallback and also identified two bounded but real denial-of-service surfaces: expensive availability searches and caller-defined regular expressions in the optional extension registry. I’m validating those exact loops and parser sinks now; database-definer leads are being kept separate from HTTP reachability so internal-only paths are not overstated.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

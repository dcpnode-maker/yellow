## 2026-08-23T15:09:47.202Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: I’m using the `codex-security:security-scan` workflow because this is an explicit Standard scan request. I’ll first read its full instructions and the pinned `core-scan.md`, then run the audit with three delegated discovery agents and submit exactly one accepted draft.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:12:08.060Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The required preflight helper is present, but this host has no installed Python interpreter (`py.exe` reports “No installed Python found”). I’m checking for a bundled interpreter or an equivalent host preflight path before treating that as a blocker; source review has not started.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:15:55.235Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: Preflight is ready. It confirms three usable worker slots (below the profile’s six-worker preference), so I’ll use the documented degraded-worker path while preserving the requested three-agent allowance. Before source review begins, I’m running the required one-time TAC advisory.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:15:59.942Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: ⚠️ TAC access status: `not_granted` (grant levels: none). Protected scan outputs may not be displayable for this account. You can apply at [Trusted Access for Cyber](https://chatgpt.com/cyber). This is advisory only; the scan will continue.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:23:45.403Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: Discovery is underway across the HTTP/authentication, PostgreSQL/RLS/function, and deployment/supply-chain surfaces. Early counterevidence is strong for DOM injection (rendering uses `textContent`, not HTML sinks), CORS/CSRF (no cookie auth or permissive CORS), and AI-provider response handling (bounded size, no redirects, proposal-only validation); I’m retaining those as resolved coverage rather than findings.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:30:50.628Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The authentication review is in: the previously suspected waiver replay is fixed, and the actorless HTTP idempotency behavior did not yield an authorization bypass after checking the surrounding scope/property controls. The one source-backed issue there is unthrottled Argon2 login work in explicitly network-exposed operator mode.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:33:58.048Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The database review found two distinct classes of boundary failure: tenant-agnostic privileged functions, and unsafe ownership/search-path/grant design around those functions. I’m calibrating them to the actual prerequisite—a SQL-capable database role, not an ordinary bearer-token request—and independently checking the booking-policy race finding before submission.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:43:02.373Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: Validation is complete. I’m submitting a calibrated draft now: one medium booking-policy bypass, two externally conditioned medium issues (login and MCP supply chain), and three low-severity PostgreSQL role-boundary findings whose exploitation requires SQL-capable database access. The known JWT fallback, owner-role posture, actorless replay lead, waiver replay, XSS/SQLi/SSRF, and optional regex path are recorded as rejected or non-reachable rather than inflated into findings.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:43:12.211Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: Security scan draft accepted for scan `23db0ae7-e827-4db9-986a-ae9cd3bc7f4b`.
AGENT-INFERRED: - Findings: 6
AGENT-INFERRED: - Coverage surfaces: 15
AGENT-INFERRED: - Status: `draft_written`
AGENT-INFERRED: Stopped after acceptance; the host owns completion.

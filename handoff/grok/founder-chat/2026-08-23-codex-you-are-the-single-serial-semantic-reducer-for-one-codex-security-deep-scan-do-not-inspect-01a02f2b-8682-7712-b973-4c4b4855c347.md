# You are the single serial semantic reducer for one Codex Security Deep Scan. Do not inspect repository code, launch subagents, validate findings, run attack-path analysis, edit the repository, or call another Deep Scan.

Use this exact reducer configuration:

```json
{
  "reducerLabel": "dedup-0004",
  "claimedWorkerIds": [
    "63d7f579-1350-45bf-8ad8-d00d91c7f4bf",
    "e8424658-38a4-4b90-813e-79bb5d878c1f"
  ]
}
```

Call `get_codex_security_deep_reducer_inputs({})` to read each assigned worker's complete, already-validated Standard scan result and the previous aggregate, if any. The scan identity, findings, coverage, threat model, and scope already use the Standard semantic scan-draft contract.

Read every finding and the previous aggregate. Merge only the same actionable root issue using remediation-subsumption: fixing the retained finding must also fix every absorbed finding. Preserve distinct reachable vulnerable instances, proof tuples, useful evidence, uncertainty, locations, provenance, severity, validation, attack paths, and remediation.

Do not merge findings merely because they share a subsystem, CWE, route or file family, sink family, or attack language. Keep them separate whenever any source/control/sink/impact tuple or independently reachable instance would remain after the proposed common fix. Related findings may be cross-referenced without being collapsed.

For a valid merge, synthesize one stronger finding while preserving every materially useful non-redundant detail: narrower exploit framings, affected subpaths, preconditions, distinct source/control/sink nuances, contradictory or strengthening evidence, affected locations, and remediation-relevant subcases. Omit only genuinely duplicate or superseded detail. Preserve previously established finding identities.

Combine the complete coverage, exclusions, deferred work, open questions, threat-model context, and optional scope from the Standard results without dropping meaningful information. Keep coverage partial whenever any deferred work or follow-up surface requires it. Retain the shared scan identity and do not add reducer-specific bookkeeping.

Call `record_codex_security_deep_reduction({ scanId, findings, coverage, threatModel?, scope? })` with one complete Standard semantic result until it succeeds; correct a reported validation error and retry in the same conversation. After the first successful call, do not call it again. The host derives convergence and worker attribution from its existing state.

## 2026-08-23T15:09:48.127Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: I’m using the Deep Security Scan skill because this turn is the reduction stage of that workflow. I’ll read its reducer instructions, then process only the assigned validated results through the two required reducer calls.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:10:13.722Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The reducer input is substantially larger than a single response window. I have the assigned scan payload and am paging through its structured findings and aggregate sections so no source instance or prior identity is lost before recording the single reduction.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:13:50.138Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The semantic overlap resolves to 13 retained issues: the 11 prior identities remain intact, two new independently reachable authentication issues are added, and duplicate worker reports are folded into the prior JWT, idempotency, database-grant, privileged-function, outbox, and MCP identities. The actor-unbound idempotency identity is strengthened to include cross-property key preemption as well as exact-response replay; the distinct database confused-deputy, PUBLIC function, mutable tenant-context, and search-path issues remain separate.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:16:19.931Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The aggregate is schema-complete, retains the shared scan ID, has no duplicate retained identities, and remains explicitly partial because runtime catalog/deployment proof, dynamic security tests, advisory/SBOM work, privacy/relay review, optional extensions, and later independent-review debt are still deferred. I’m recording this complete Standard result now.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:16:26.980Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: Reduction recorded successfully for scan `3c2cc7cc-00b5-4264-959a-6820079148a6`.
AGENT-INFERRED: - Retained findings: 13
AGENT-INFERRED: - Assigned worker results consumed: 2
AGENT-INFERRED: - Coverage remains partial due to documented deferred work
AGENT-INFERRED: - Prior finding identities were preserved

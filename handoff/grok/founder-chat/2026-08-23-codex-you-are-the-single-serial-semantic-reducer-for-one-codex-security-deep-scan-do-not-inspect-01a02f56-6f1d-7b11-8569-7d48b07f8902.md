# You are the single serial semantic reducer for one Codex Security Deep Scan. Do not inspect repository code, launch subagents, validate findings, run attack-path analysis, edit the repository, or call another Deep Scan.

Use this exact reducer configuration:

```json
{
  "reducerLabel": "dedup-0018",
  "claimedWorkerIds": [
    "8688cc8e-0e81-429c-9ab8-20bbef5d8ec2"
  ]
}
```

Call `get_codex_security_deep_reducer_inputs({})` to read each assigned worker's complete, already-validated Standard scan result and the previous aggregate, if any. The scan identity, findings, coverage, threat model, and scope already use the Standard semantic scan-draft contract.

Read every finding and the previous aggregate. Merge only the same actionable root issue using remediation-subsumption: fixing the retained finding must also fix every absorbed finding. Preserve distinct reachable vulnerable instances, proof tuples, useful evidence, uncertainty, locations, provenance, severity, validation, attack paths, and remediation.

Do not merge findings merely because they share a subsystem, CWE, route or file family, sink family, or attack language. Keep them separate whenever any source/control/sink/impact tuple or independently reachable instance would remain after the proposed common fix. Related findings may be cross-referenced without being collapsed.

For a valid merge, synthesize one stronger finding while preserving every materially useful non-redundant detail: narrower exploit framings, affected subpaths, preconditions, distinct source/control/sink nuances, contradictory or strengthening evidence, affected locations, and remediation-relevant subcases. Omit only genuinely duplicate or superseded detail. Preserve previously established finding identities.

Combine the complete coverage, exclusions, deferred work, open questions, threat-model context, and optional scope from the Standard results without dropping meaningful information. Keep coverage partial whenever any deferred work or follow-up surface requires it. Retain the shared scan identity and do not add reducer-specific bookkeeping.

Call `record_codex_security_deep_reduction({ scanId, findings, coverage, threatModel?, scope? })` with one complete Standard semantic result until it succeeds; correct a reported validation error and retry in the same conversation. After the first successful call, do not call it again. The host derives convergence and worker attribution from its existing state.

You are the single serial semantic reducer for one Codex Security Deep Scan. Do not inspect repository code, launch subagents, validate findings, run attack-path analysis, edit the repository, or call another Deep Scan.

Use this exact reducer configuration:

```json
{
  "reducerLabel": "dedup-0018",
  "claimedWorkerIds": [
    "8688cc8e-0e81-429c-9ab8-20bbef5d8ec2"
  ]
}
```

Call `get_codex_security_deep_reducer_inputs({})` to read each assigned worker's complete, already-validated Standard scan result and the previous aggregate, if any. The scan identity, findings, coverage, threat model, and scope already use the Standard semantic scan-draft contract.

Read every finding and the previous aggregate. Merge only the same actionable root issue using remediation-subsumption: fixing the retained finding must also fix every absorbed finding. Preserve distinct reachable vulnerable instances, proof tuples, useful evidence, uncertainty, locations, provenance, severity, validation, attack paths, and remediation.

Do not merge findings merely because they share a subsystem, CWE, route or file family, sink family, or attack language. Keep them separate whenever any source/control/sink/impact tuple or independently reachable instance would remain after the proposed common fix. Related findings may be cross-referenced without being collapsed.

For a valid merge, synthesize one stronger finding while preserving every materially useful non-redundant detail: narrower exploit framings, affected subpaths, preconditions, distinct source/control/sink nuances, contradictory or strengthening evidence, affected locations, and remediation-relevant subcases. Omit only genuinely duplicate or superseded detail. Preserve previously established finding identities.

Combine the complete coverage, exclusions, deferred work, open questions, threat-model context, and optional scope from the Standard results without dropping meaningful information. Keep coverage partial whenever any deferred work or follow-up surface requires it. Retain the shared scan identity and do not add reducer-specific bookkeeping.

Call `record_codex_security_deep_reduction({ scanId, findings, coverage, threatModel?, scope? })` with one complete Standard semantic result until it succeeds; correct a reported validation error and retry in the same conversation. After the first successful call, do not call it again. The host derives convergence and worker attribution from its existing state.


## 2026-08-23T15:56:39.321Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: I’ll load the assigned validated scan result and any prior aggregate, reduce them strictly by remediation-subsumption, then record the complete semantic result exactly once after it validates.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:56:54.381Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The reducer input is substantially larger than the display limit, so I’m preserving it internally and reviewing it in bounded sections. I’ll keep all distinct instances and only collapse findings where one remediation fully subsumes the others.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:59:36.707Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The eight assigned findings reduce into eight already-established identities in the prior aggregate: database-owner credential reuse, known JWT fallback, Argon2 admission control, offer-search amplification, actor-bound idempotency, metered AI use inside a DB transaction, unbounded operator collections, and mutable MCP packages. The distinct 30 prior findings remain separate; the new evidence and remediation-relevant subcases are being folded into those retained identities.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T16:01:01.985Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The reduced result retains 30 distinct findings, keeps coverage partial, and carries forward the full threat model, scope, exclusions, deferred work, and open questions. I’m submitting that complete aggregate now; if the recorder reports a schema error, I’ll correct only that error and retry.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T16:01:07.398Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: Reduction recorded successfully for scan `23db0ae7-e827-4db9-986a-ae9cd3bc7f4b`.
AGENT-INFERRED: - Retained findings: 30
AGENT-INFERRED: - Consumed worker: `8688cc8e-0e81-429c-9ab8-20bbef5d8ec2`
AGENT-INFERRED: - Coverage remains partial due to retained deferred work
AGENT-INFERRED: - Recorder called successfully once

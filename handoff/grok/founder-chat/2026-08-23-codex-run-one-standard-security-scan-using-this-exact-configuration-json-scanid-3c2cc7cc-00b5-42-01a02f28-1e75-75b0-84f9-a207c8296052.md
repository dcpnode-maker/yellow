## 2026-08-23T15:06:08.795Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: I’m using the Codex Security scan skill and the specified plugin audit instructions. I’ll keep the repository read-only, treat the founder context strictly as untrusted scope guidance, and use three delegated workers as requested once I’ve loaded the complete scan protocol.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:07:02.864Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The required protocol adds a capability preflight before any source inspection. I’m dispatching that check with the verified native runtime facts (four total slots, delegation available); repository review will begin only if it returns `ready`.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:07:47.959Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The preflight itself did not run because `python` is absent from `PATH`; no repository content was touched. I’m having the same worker resolve the installed Windows Python launcher/interpreter and retry once with the unchanged runtime facts.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:08:53.171Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The launcher exists but has no registered interpreter. Before declaring the scan blocked, I’m checking standard local installation locations and the plugin bundle for an already-installed Python executable—read-only and offline—then I’ll rerun only if one is found.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:10:23.285Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: One last non-source check is still available: the repository may already carry a local virtual environment, or Windows may register an interpreter outside the usual paths. I’m checking those exact locations and registry entries; I will not inspect application files unless preflight succeeds.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:11:11.588Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The Standard scan could not start because the mandatory capability preflight requires Python, but no accessible Python interpreter is installed or registered.
AGENT-INFERRED: - `python`: unavailable
AGENT-INFERRED: - `py -3`: launcher exists, but reports no installed Python
AGENT-INFERRED: - Standard install paths, virtual environments, registry entries, and offline `uv` lookup yielded no usable interpreter
AGENT-INFERRED: - Repository source was not inspected or modified

## 2026-08-23T15:12:22.222Z — FOUNDER: verbatim recorded user message

Continue the existing Standard security scan after attempt 1 ended without its semantic result.
Preserve your completed source analysis and submit its complete result once with
record_codex_security_scan_draft({ scanId, scope?, threatModel?, findings, coverage }).
If the tool rejects the arguments, correct them and retry the same submission until it succeeds.
Return immediately after the submission succeeds.

## 2026-08-23T15:12:41.981Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: I’m resuming the same host-owned Standard scan and using the Security Scan continuation rules. I’ll first recover any preserved semantic analysis from the scan workspace; I will submit only evidence-backed data and return as soon as the draft is accepted.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:13:36.090Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: No preserved semantic artifacts or prior source-review output exist in the scan workspace, so there is nothing evidence-backed to recover. I’m preparing an honest partial draft: zero asserted vulnerabilities, the entire authorized repository explicitly deferred, and the mandatory preflight failure recorded as the coverage limitation—never as a clean security result.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:14:20.803Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: Semantic draft accepted for scan `3c2cc7cc-00b5-4264-959a-6820079148a6`.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

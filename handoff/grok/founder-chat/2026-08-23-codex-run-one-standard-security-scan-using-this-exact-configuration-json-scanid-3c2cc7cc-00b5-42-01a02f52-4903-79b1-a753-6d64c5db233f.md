## 2026-08-23T15:52:08.329Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: I’m using the Codex Security `security-scan` skill because this is an explicitly configured Standard scan. I’ll first load its complete instructions and the requested `core-scan.md`, then run the read-only audit with three delegated workers and submit exactly one accepted result.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:52:18.832Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The security-scan instructions require a capability preflight before any repository review or worker launch. I’m loading that preflight contract now and will use the host’s registered scan rather than creating or finalizing a second one.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:52:51.789Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The initial preflight could not start because `python` is not installed on this host’s PATH; no repository review has begun. I’m resolving an existing local interpreter (without installing or downloading anything) and will rerun the same required check once.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:54:12.343Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: Preflight is ready. The host exposes three usable delegated-worker slots—enough for the requested baseline plus two focused investigators, though below the skill’s six-slot quality recommendation—so I’ll use the documented degraded-capacity path without changing configuration. Before source review, the skill requires one advisory TAC-status check; it does not gate or authorize the scan.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:54:17.316Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: ## TAC access warning
AGENT-INFERRED: TAC status is `not_granted` for this account, with no grant levels returned. The scan will continue because this check is advisory, but protected scan outputs may not be displayable. You can apply at [Trusted Access for Cyber](https://chatgpt.com/cyber).

## 2026-08-23T15:54:59.414Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The repository is readable, and native `rg` is verified. Git’s ownership safety check blocks ordinary metadata commands under the read-only sandbox; I’ll use Git’s per-command `safe.directory` override (non-persistent, no file/config mutation) to verify branch and HEAD. I’m now launching the independent baseline auditor required by the skill.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T15:56:52.386Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The current branch matches, but HEAD is `18bf20b884746f83da55956d21ef7897e8cbb46c`, not the expected `dd6d97f`; I’ll preserve that as a scope/revision discrepancy rather than inspect history. The threat map now supports two independent packet groups, so I’m launching the remaining two requested workers: one for HTTP/auth/business logic and one for PostgreSQL/deployment/data exposure.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T16:01:00.197Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The first source-backed results are taking shape. The cancellation-waiver path is now bound to tenant, reservation, requester, exact payload, and prior-use facts under row locks, so I’m treating that prior lead as fixed rather than reporting it. The actor binding is present in reservation lifecycle idempotency, but the shared operator idempotency wrappers still omit actor identity; database function privileges also require closer validation.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T16:04:17.107Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: I’ve confirmed several counter-controls too: strict JWT algorithm/issuer/audience/TTL checks, generic login failures, property-grant checks, parameterized database inputs, DOM `textContent` rendering, one-shot rate publication state, and transaction/exclusion/advisory locking. Runtime role attributes, applied RLS state, external exposure, and dependency advisories cannot be established from this read-only offline source pass and will be recorded as deferred—not promoted into vulnerabilities.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T16:08:34.899Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The authentication/business-logic pass is back. It confirmed the waiver, approval, occupancy-race, JWT, SQL-injection, and XSS leads are closed in current source, but surfaced conditional risks in the optional extension API; I’m checking whether that API is actually reachable in this repository’s shipped runtime before deciding whether those belong as vulnerabilities or deferred attack surface.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T16:10:37.632Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: So far, the optional extension handlers are not mounted by `src/server.ts`; their vulnerable authorization and regex paths are exercised only by test-created app instances. I’m therefore treating them as latent/conditional attack surface rather than current shipped-runtime findings unless the remaining repository/deployment pass finds another activation path.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T16:12:01.606Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The database pass found a stronger version of the definer issue: the remaining executable functions use unsafe relation resolution (`public`, or no fixed path), so a database principal with `EXECUTE` and temporary-schema access may be able to shadow referenced tables and run trigger-side effects as the migration owner. I’m validating the PostgreSQL resolution semantics independently before reporting that escalation path.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

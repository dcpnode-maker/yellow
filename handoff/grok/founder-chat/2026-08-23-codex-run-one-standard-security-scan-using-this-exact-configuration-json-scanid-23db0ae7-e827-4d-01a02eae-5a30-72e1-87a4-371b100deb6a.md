## 2026-08-23T12:53:09.147Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: I’m using the codex-security Standard scan workflow because this request explicitly calls for its core audit and submission contract. I’ll first load the skill and the specified `core-scan.md`, then split the repository review across the requested three subagents while I coordinate coverage and validate findings.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T12:53:17.142Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The first read attempt hit a Windows process/work-directory error before accessing any files. I’m retrying with the runtime’s default directory, then I’ll continue from the plugin instructions.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T12:54:01.436Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The capability helper is present, but the default `python` command is not installed on this host. I’m resolving the available configured interpreter locally and will rerun the same preflight without touching the repository.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T12:55:08.224Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: Preflight is ready. The host exposes three usable worker slots—the exact requested allowance—though the profile notes that six would permit broader parallelism. I’m now performing the required one-time access advisory; it is informational and will not gate the scan.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T12:55:24.465Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: ⚠️ TAC access could not be verified because the Codex Security Access connector is not connected. Protected scan outputs may not be displayable. Enrollment/access setup: [chatgpt.com/cyber](https://chatgpt.com/cyber)
AGENT-INFERRED: The advisory does not block the scan. I’m continuing with the authorized read-only checkout and offline review.

## 2026-08-23T12:56:12.695Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The independent baseline auditor is running. I’m mapping the actual entry points and trust boundaries now; the Git ownership warning is handled with per-command read-only `safe.directory` overrides, so no user or repository configuration is changed.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T12:59:57.326Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: All three requested workers are active: one independent baseline and two focused investigations. I’m covering the remaining surfaces locally—deployment defaults, dependencies, secrets, logging/PII, generic injection/resource-exhaustion sinks—and will validate every candidate against the current checkout before submission.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T13:06:59.363Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The current-source checks are narrowing the picture: DOM rendering uses text-only sinks and a restrictive CSP; SQL interpolation is either parameterized or fixed/validated; AI responses are size- and timeout-bounded. Two separate local-tooling risks remain source-backed—project MCP packages execute from mutable npm tags, and the PostgreSQL MCP is configured with the database-owner DSN—while the HTTP/database leads are still being independently validated.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T13:10:28.367Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: I’ve completed the independent baseline and the main source review. The remaining focused passes are validating severity and reachability for the database/RLS and API/business-logic leads; I’m holding the draft until those checks land so duplicate or defense-in-depth issues don’t get promoted as exploitable findings.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T13:13:01.683Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The database pass confirmed two especially important boundary details: `app_role` can rewrite the custom tenant GUC that RLS trusts, and the default runtime login can restore the object-owner role after `SET LOCAL ROLE`. Neither is directly reachable from an operator HTTP route in the frozen checkout, so I’m calibrating them as constrained database-session paths rather than treating their worst-case impact as their likelihood. It also confirmed the occupancy race controls and cancellation-waiver one-shot logic hold under concurrency.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T13:14:50.791Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The final focused pass found no route-matrix bypass, cancellation-waiver replay, approval race, DOM/SQL injection, CSRF, or AI/OTA credential boundary failure. It did confirm two conditional API issues: the known HS256 fallback becomes exploitable only when the optional workbench is enabled and reachable, and the public login has no throttling. I’m now consolidating shared-root findings and applying the Standard scan’s required likelihood downgrades for localhost, same-tenant, and database-session prerequisites.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T13:21:07.326Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: Consolidation is complete: eight unique source-backed findings remain—two medium-severity deployment/tooling risks and six low-severity conditional or constrained issues. Findings that shared the same broken control were merged, while the unproven temporary-table `search_path` escalation was kept out of the finding set; the directly reachable function ACL and cross-tenant effects are reported independently. I’m submitting the semantic draft now.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T13:21:18.986Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: Security scan draft accepted with status `draft_written`.
AGENT-INFERRED: - Scan ID: `23db0ae7-e827-4db9-986a-ae9cd3bc7f4b`

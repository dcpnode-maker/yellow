## 2026-08-24T04:11:57.505Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: I’m using the Codex Security scan skill because this request is a Standard repository audit. I’ll first load the skill and the specified `core-scan.md`, then run the read-only review with three parallel subagents and submit exactly one accepted draft for the supplied scan ID.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-24T04:12:16.625Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The skill requires a host capability preflight before source review or delegation. I’ve loaded the complete Standard-scan instructions; I’m now resolving that preflight, the authorized repository state, inherited security policy, and a native offline search command.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-24T04:15:05.528Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: Preflight is `ready`. The only warning is that this session has three usable worker slots versus the profile’s suggested six; delegation itself is available, so I’ll use the requested three subagents (one baseline auditor and two focused investigators). Before reviewing source, the skill requires one advisory TAC status check; it does not gate the scan.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-24T04:15:12.346Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: TAC status is `granted` at level `tac1`. I’m beginning the source audit now: first resolving inherited repository policy and the exact current-state inventory, then launching the independent baseline auditor immediately as required by the scan skill.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-24T04:16:41.185Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The threat map has resolved into two independent packet groups: (1) HTTP authentication, operator identity/property authorization, Party PII, browser rendering, and actor-bound idempotency; (2) PostgreSQL runtime roles/RLS, definer functions and grants, occupancy choke points, approvals, and outbox retention. I’m assigning one focused investigator to each while I continue validating configuration and cross-component reachability.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-24T04:21:42.328Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: Initial validation is converging on concrete, bounded issues rather than broad control gaps: the operator API consistently derives actors from bearer «REDACTED-SECRET» and most property routes re-check grants; Party creation binds idempotency to actor and property; approval transitions are atomic and cancellation waivers are subject/actor/exact-payload bound. I’m now validating the remaining cross-property Party search, generic operator idempotency, database definer grants, and deployment defaults against the report schema.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-24T04:25:10.013Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The remaining deployment findings are now bounded by exact preconditions: Compose binds both app and PostgreSQL to host loopback, so the shipped known token/database credentials are local-review risks unless a port or reverse proxy is broadened; PostgreSQL request transactions do drop to `app_role`, so I’m not treating the schema-owner DSN alone as an HTTP tenant-bypass. The definer findings remain independently reachable only to a database principal (or a separate SQL-injection foothold, which the reviewed code did not establish).
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-24T04:30:09.089Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The operator/authentication slice is complete. Its source-backed issues are deployment-bounded: a known default signing secret, unthrottled expensive local-login verification, and actorless generic idempotency records; several suspected Party, SQL injection, XSS, SSRF, and approval paths were ruled out. I’m reconciling the database and baseline slices before the single submission.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-24T04:32:33.743Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: Database inspection confirms the application’s normal request transaction explicitly switches to `app_role` after setting the tenant context, so the schema-owner DSN is not by itself an HTTP RLS bypass. The remaining database questions are narrower: direct-login exposure of known local credentials and over-privileged `SECURITY DEFINER` entry points.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-24T04:34:11.727Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: All three review tracks have converged. I’m calibrating severity to the demonstrated attacker boundary: ordinary HTTP callers are separated from `app_role`, while direct database principals can reach materially stronger cross-tenant and definer-function paths. Findings will state those preconditions explicitly rather than presenting them as Internet-reachable by default.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-24T04:36:26.295Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: I’ve finished severity reconciliation and am submitting the single semantic draft now. The draft separates current loopback/development conditions from public-deployment change conditions and records runtime testing, dependency advisories, and Git-history secret analysis as unavailable rather than implying they were completed.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-24T03:44:38.500Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: I’m using the Codex Security standard-scan skill because this request specifies its scan protocol and submission contract. I’ll first read the skill and the exact `core-scan.md`, then split the repository audit across the requested three subagents while I coordinate validation and the final single submission.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-24T03:45:16.388Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The scan protocol requires a capability preflight before any repository inspection. I’ve verified that this session exposes delegation with three worker slots (four threads including the coordinator), so I’m running the prescribed `security_scan` preflight first; no target source has been opened yet.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-24T03:46:22.449Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The first preflight attempt found only the Windows Python launcher, but no registered Python runtime. I’m checking the existing local installations for a usable interpreter; this is recovery of the required preflight and still does not inspect the repository.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-24T03:47:00.795Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: Preflight is ready. It notes the profile’s optional six-worker suggestion is unmet, but the requested three subagents are available, so the Standard scan can proceed without reducing the requested worker count. I’m now performing the required one-time TAC advisory check before opening repository source.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-24T03:47:18.654Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: TAC status is `granted` at level `tac1`. I’m resolving the repository’s inherited security policy and a local offline search binary, then I’ll start the independent baseline auditor—the first of the three requested scan subagents.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-24T03:48:59.502Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The initial map shows two distinct investigation domains, so I’m assigning the remaining two scan subagents now: one to PostgreSQL tenant/role/definer boundaries, and one to HTTP identity, operator business logic, PII, approval/idempotency, and outbound-input boundaries. They’ll trace actual controls and counterevidence rather than treating the supplied leads as findings.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-24T03:58:09.604Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The local evidence so far confirms several strong controls—transaction-local tenant context followed by `SET LOCAL ROLE app_role`, per-route scope plus property-grant checks, parameterized SQL, masked contact hints, strict DOM text rendering, and payload-bound approval transitions. I’m now separating those controls from the narrower conditional risks (deployment defaults, login abuse, idempotency actor ownership, and database-function privilege boundaries) before submission.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-24T03:59:07.518Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: A notable working-tree-only surface appeared in the hidden inventory: the untracked repository-local Codex configuration defines `npx -y` MCP commands, including an `@latest` package, and passes local database/GitHub credentials to those processes. I’m treating this as a developer-tool supply-chain boundary and validating its exact trust/activation preconditions; I will not execute any of those repository-defined commands.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-24T04:02:43.157Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The focused application and database reviews are complete. I’m reconciling their claims against the actual working tree now—especially deployment-only preconditions and the Party visibility model—before I submit the single draft.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-24T04:06:58.063Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: Reconciliation is complete: Party search is intentionally tenant-wide and still property-gated/masked, so I’m not treating that as a vulnerability. The database-function claims remain reportable only with explicit database-principal preconditions; the normal HTTP transaction path does set the tenant context and drops to `app_role`. I’m submitting the consolidated draft now.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-24T04:12:53.592Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: Security scan draft accepted for scan `e2a116cd-6e6d-4c8d-a741-9fa5c9f33fbb`.
AGENT-INFERRED: Recorded 9 findings across 12 reviewed surfaces. Host status: `draft_written`.

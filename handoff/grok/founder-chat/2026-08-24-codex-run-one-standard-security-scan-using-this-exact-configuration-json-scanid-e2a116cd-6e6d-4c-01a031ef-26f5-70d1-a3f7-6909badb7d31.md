## 2026-08-24T04:02:45.559Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: I’m starting the Standard scan with the supplied identifiers and read-only constraints. I’ll first load the plugin’s full core-scan procedure, then audit the specified repository and submit exactly one draft, retrying only if the recorder explicitly rejects it.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-24T04:04:11.180Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The plugin procedure is loaded in full. The repository has no root-level `SECURITY.md`; a policy exists only under `docs/`, and the required resolver script is present, but Windows’ Python launcher has no interpreter registered. I’m locating an offline interpreter so the policy can be resolved exactly before delegation; no repository files are being executed or modified.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-24T04:08:16.193Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The scan has mapped two independent high-value surfaces and is now using the requested three-agent allowance: one baseline auditor, one database/tenant-boundary investigator, and one HTTP identity/business-logic investigator. The packet split is based on actual entry points and sensitive operations found in `server.ts`, `operator.ts`, the kernel services, and SQL migrations.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-24T04:18:36.372Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: Current validation separates the expected deployment blockers from local-only conditions. The fixed token secret and lack of login throttling are not remotely reachable in the repository’s default loopback/disabled mode, but become exploitable when the workbench is enabled behind a public listener or proxy. Separately, the repository’s MCP configs would auto-install unpinned packages and hand them a database DSN/GitHub token when trusted tooling activates those configs; that is an independent developer supply-chain boundary.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-24T04:20:49.901Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The focused reviews are complete. They confirmed the known leads and surfaced four database-grant issues that need careful calibration because their precondition is direct SQL access as the trusted runtime role, not a tenant HTTP request. I’m validating those ACLs against the final schema now and will report that distinction explicitly.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-24T04:22:08.442Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The final-schema ACLs support the direct-database findings, but they do not create a public HTTP exploit. I’m therefore treating the owner DSN and public JWT fallback as deployment blockers, while calibrating the app-role-only occupancy, global-table, document, and definer-function paths as lower-severity internal-boundary failures with their SQL-access prerequisites stated.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-24T04:22:35.995Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The draft is assembled with ten distinct findings: four medium-severity deployment/developer-workstation risks and six low-severity conditional or internal-boundary failures. Cross-tenant/destructive items identify direct SQL access, known identifiers, or public exposure as explicit prerequisites; the absence of those prerequisites is captured as counterevidence rather than silently assumed. I’m submitting the single draft now.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-24T04:27:52.346Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: Scan draft accepted for `e2a116cd-6e6d-4c8d-a741-9fa5c9f33fbb`: 10 findings across 12 security surfaces. Host owns completion.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

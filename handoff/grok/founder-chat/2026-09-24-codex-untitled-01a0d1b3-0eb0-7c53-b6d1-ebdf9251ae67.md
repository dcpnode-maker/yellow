Source: local Codex rollout, read without modifying it. Dates are UTC. Founder-labelled entries are original user-role records in a user thread; relays identified by metadata or text are labelled separately. Unidentifiable relays remain a provenance limitation. Assistant entries are verbatim claim excerpts, not independent proof.

# AGENTS.md — adapter for OpenAI Codex (and other AGENTS.md-reading tools)

## STOP. Read `PROJECT.md` first.
It is the canonical constitution: the Ten Invariants, module boundaries, coding
standards, never-do list, session ritual. **This file adds only your role.** If this
file ever contradicts PROJECT.md, PROJECT.md wins.

Then run `./state.sh` — ground truth, identical for every agent.

## Your role: PRIMARY IMPLEMENTATION AND COORDINATION OWNER

**Effective 2026-08-23** (founder directive, `DECISIONS.log` D-91; full context in
`handoff/CODEX-HANDOFF.md`), Codex owns Yellow's implementation end to end. Claude is
no longer required for planning, implementation, order creation, intermediate review,
or continuation. Claude may review the finished application only if the founder
explicitly asks for that.

You are authorized to:
- act as primary implementation and coordination owner;
- create, revise, execute, and close scoped implementation orders in `handoff/orders/`;
- complete every remaining phase in `BUILD-PLAN.md` and `handoff/ROADMAP.md`;
- make routine technical decisions within the documented architecture;
- create branches, commits, tests, documentation, and pull requests;
- coordinate multiple local or cloud LLM agents for parallel implementation and
  independent review;
- choose models by risk, cost, speed, and capability;
- continue between orders and phases without asking permission first;
- update governance when necessary, while preserving founder authority, safety, and
  auditability — `PROJECT.md` remains the canonical constitution, unchanged.

**Routine work**: implement and complete it once all relevant tests and repository
gates pass (the standing self-check in `handoff/ROADMAP.md`; the referee in
`PROJECT.md`).

**High-risk work** — migrations, RLS, tenant scoping, occupancy, journals/posting,
fiscal chains, payments, document numbering, new tables/events, state transitions,
statutory reporting, trust accounting, destructive data handling — requires an
**independent agent that did not implement the change** to inspect it and personally
execute the relevant proof. D-84's rule stays binding (non-waivable, reviewer-executed
— a result pasted by the implementer is not proof); only the identity requirement
changed: the reviewer no longer has to be Claude. Record the reviewer, findings,
commands, and results in `handoff/reviews/` and `handoff/LEDGER.md`.

Ask the **founder** — not any AI agent — only for: credentials, spending,
legal/business policy, irreversible external actions, missing product intent, or
authority outside this directive. Claude's absence is never treated as a blocker.

When coordinating multiple agents: every delegated task is concrete and bounded;
Codex maintains one authoritative plan; agents do not make conflicting edits without
coordination; every agent follows repository instructions and scope; review agents
never review their own implementation; Codex integrates and verifies all delegated
work; parallelism never replaces executable verification; sensitive data is not
shared externally without authorization.

## Standing rules (unchanged by the directive)

- **Work only from an order** in `handoff/orders/`. No order → no code.
- Branch `phase-N/slug`; commits prefixed `[codex]`; PR when green.
- Run `./setup.sh --db-only` **before** opening the PR. `11 passed, 0 failed` or it
  isn't reviewable. Paste the output in the PR body.
- **Stay inside the order's Scope list.** If the work seems to need a file outside
  it, STOP and write `handoff/questions/NNN.md` — never widen scope silently.
- Never merge your own PR. Never edit `migrations/0001_init.sql`.
- Before deciding anything: `grep -i "<topic>" DECISIONS.log`. The answer may already
  exist, and re-deciding it wastes budget and creates contradictions.

## Model policy
Same principle as the Claude adapter, applied to your roster: reserve the most
capable model for phase kickoffs and anything foundational; use faster/cheaper models
for routine implementation and scaffolding. Configure in `~/.codex/config.toml`.
MCP servers for this project: `.codex/config.toml` (see `docs/CODEX.md`).

Review authority and tiers: `handoff/ROSTER.md`. The loop: `docs/WORKFLOW.md`.

## 2026-09-24T04:36:16.321Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: I’m reviewing the folio UI changes against the order and the existing financial controls. I’ll run the focused tests myself and record any findings in the review file.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-09-24T04:36:55.197Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The finance diff keeps the command forms mounted inside disclosures and adds window switching locks during posting, transfer, receivable, and deposit work. I’m checking whether the new balance cards and statement table still use the server’s exact amounts and whether uncertain attempts remain recoverable.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-09-24T04:38:17.368Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The two existing cashier regression suites pass: «REDACTED-SECRET» tests, 0 failures. I found one navigation path that may bypass the lock shown on the new window cards during a retained transfer attempt; I’ve sent the exact path to the implementation owner and will verify the final version.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-09-24T04:40:19.083Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The review is documented as pending. The remaining check is whether the final integration closes the alternate navigation path during financial recovery; the focused cashier tests are already green.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-09-24T04:41:48.721Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The repaired navigation checks now cover reservation selection, window selection, and exact-folio lookup during active or uncertain financial work. I reran all five targeted test files: 25 passed, 0 failed. The command and recovery paths remain intact in the inspected source.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-09-24T04:42:53.385Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: Order 672’s scoped finance UI review is accepted. I verified the navigation and recovery fixes and personally reran the targeted tests: 25 passed, 0 failed (184 assertions). The [review record](C:/Users/astha/Documents/Codex/2026-08-14/cl/outputs/yellow/handoff/reviews/672-folio-workbench-search-cleanup.md) documents the findings and their resolution. This review does not cover database or browser proof.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

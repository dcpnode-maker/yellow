## 2026-08-23T12:49:18.427Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: I’m using the Codex Security scan workflow specified by the installed plugin. I’ll first read its complete core-scan instructions, then inspect the frozen checkout with three delegated discovery workers and submit exactly one Standard-scan result, retrying only if the host rejects it.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T12:50:58.628Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: TAC access could not be verified because the Codex Security Access connector is not connected; protected scan outputs may therefore not be displayable. The scan will continue because this check is advisory.
AGENT-INFERRED: Capability preflight is ready. The active four-thread session provides three worker slots—enough for the requested three subagents, though below the workflow’s six-slot quality recommendation.

## 2026-08-23T12:51:11.335Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The security workflow now starts its source-review phase: one worker is taking the independent baseline audit, while I map the repository and prepare two focused investigation packets. No repository files will be changed.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T12:59:02.870Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The review has reached validation. Current evidence confirms that the reservation lifecycle binds cancellation idempotency to the actor and rejects a previously consumed waiver; the occupancy paths also validate tenant/property mappings before invoking the database helpers. I’m separately validating the remaining idempotency, credential-default, and login-abuse candidates before reporting them.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T13:03:35.588Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: The database helper concerns are currently classifying as defense-in-depth: reviewed HTTP paths validate tenant/property mappings before invoking them, and the application role cannot issue arbitrary SQL. I’m waiting on the three independent reviews before fixing the final finding set and coverage gaps.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T13:06:21.340Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: Two concrete weaknesses remain after source tracing: shared tenant-level idempotency records can replay another authorized operator’s cached response, and the Compose JWT fallback is a public secret that still passes the signer’s length-only check. The no-rate-limit login path is still being severity-checked against its loopback/workbench deployment gates.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T13:12:18.380Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: Independent source checks agree on the reachable business-logic issues and also confirm that the reported cancellation-waiver replay and occupancy races are fixed. Database-owner, cross-tenant helper, and `prune_outbox` concerns require direct SQL or a previously compromised runtime, so I’m separating those as architectural hardening instead of overstating them as HTTP exploits.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)

## 2026-08-23T13:16:41.837Z — assistant claim excerpt

AGENT-INFERRED: I’ve completed consolidation under the Standard-scan schema. The draft will report six reachable/current weaknesses; the SQL-only helper leads, optional extension regex path, waiver replay, and occupancy-race leads are recorded with their validated dispositions rather than promoted into unsupported findings.
AGENT-INFERRED: (Only one non-empty line was recorded.)
